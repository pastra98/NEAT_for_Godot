extends RigidBody2D

"""Credit for the original version of this script goes to Ivan Skodje. This is a
modified version of his top_down_vehicle.gd script, which can be found at:
github.com/ivanskodje-godotengine/Vehicle-Controller-2D

The script overrides the behavior of a rigidbody to produce an arcade style top-down
car that can also drift. I have changed the parameters to allow very sharp turns and
high acceleration.

Initially I used a controller class that simply calls the act() method on the standard
car.gd class that is used by the AI, but this did not result in very smooth steering.
Steering based on keyboard input happens during the _physics_process().
