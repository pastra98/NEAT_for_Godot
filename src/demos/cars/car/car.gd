modified version of his top_down_vehicle.gd script, which can be found at:
github.com/ivanskodje-godotengine/Vehicle-Controller-2D

The script overrides the behavior of a rigidbody to produce an arcade style top-down
car that can also drift. I have changed the parameters to allow very sharp turns and
high acceleration. All steering happens during the act() method.
