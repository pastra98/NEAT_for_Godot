class_name Neuron
extends RefCounted

"""Neurons are created when a new population of genomes is created in
ga.create_initial_population(), or when an existing link between neurons is split.
They contain information about their spatial position in the network, whether they
are connected to themselves via a link (loop_back) and how they change the curve of
their activation function.
The class stores an array of input_connections that holds references to the other
neurons a neuron connects to, along with the associated weight, but the array is
only filled using the connect_input() method when a new network gets built.
