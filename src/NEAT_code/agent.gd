extends RefCounted

""" Agents may only be created by the GeneticAlgorithm class. Agents generate the
entity that interacts with the world. This is the agents body. The Agent is also
provided upon its creation a neural network that was coded for by the genome that
generated the agent.

The Agent provides a sort of interface for the GA class to handle all interactions
between the body, controlled by a neural network, and the environment it lives in.

The body must have a method called act(), that uses the outputs of the neural network.
Furthermore a method called sense() must be provided, that returns an array containing
the observations from the environment which are used as inputs to the nn. The third
method that the body must have is called get_fitness(), which returns a POSITIVE
real or integer number that represents how well the agent has acted in this generation.

Lastly, the agent must emit a 'death' signal if it dies.
